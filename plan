1. parse the map, decide height + width
2. check for validity : rectangular shape, walls all around, valid paths, only one character, one exit, 
	--> Error no valid map
----	a. file name with .ber extrnsion?
----	c. check rectangular --> check that all the rows and all the colums correspond to height + width
----	d. check surrounded by walls (first + last row and first + last columns only 1)
----	e. check if all elements are there
	f. check if path is playable (not less than size of 3)
	--> FLOOD FILL: 
	a. make fill function with recursion inside: 
	- if position out of bounds, return
	- if position is already filled or if it's not target, return 
	- mark position as checked 
	- call same fill function for position up, down, left, right
	b. flood fill function with start position, call fill function 
3. transfer map into game structure --> allocate memory for amount of lines + get next line into 2dimensional array

TO DO 
1. handle maximum screen size for map maximum lines and rows 
2. make function to determine image width + height
